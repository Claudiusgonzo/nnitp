nnitp: Neural net interpretability with Bayesian interpolants
=============================================================

Nnitp is a tool for interpretability of neural network inferences
using Bayesian interpolants. The basic technique is described in
`this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04198>`_. It currently supports
convolutional neural networks for image classification, using the
`Keras <https://keras.io/>`_ framework.
